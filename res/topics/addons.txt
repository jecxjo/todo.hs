Addon Scripts
-------------

Addon support allows for adding commands without having to add them to the
original code base. They can be written in any language, placing the compiled
executable or executable script into a searchable directory. The addon is
passed the environment variable TODO_PATH and optional command line arguments,
the rest is up to the addon.

Set environment variable TODO_ADDON_PATH or the command line argument -S to
define the directory containing addons. Addons need to be marked executable.

Example:

    #!/bin/sh
    CNT=$(cat "${TODO_PATH}" | grep -v "^x " | wc -l)
    CNT_DONE=$(cat "${TODO_PATH}" | grep "^x " | wc -l)
    echo "Task Count: ${CNT} active, ${CNT_DONE} completed"
    exit 0

$ todo counts
Task Count: 5 active, 3 completed
