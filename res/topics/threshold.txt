Threshold
---------

Todo.txt supports delaying tasks using the thresholds addon. Supplying a
threshold, the tasks will not show up in your list until the day of the
threshold. Thresholds are denoted using the key "t", dates are stored in the
format YYYY-MM-DD.

    (A) Pay taxes t:2018-01-01 due:2018-04-17

The following task will not be visible until Jan 1st, 2018 and is due on April
17 of the same year.

When using any commands to list or search for tasks, the task ID will be
consumed for tasks not past their threshold, but will not be visible.

    $ todo
    1: Pick up milk @Groceries
    3: Pay last year's taxes t:2017-01-01 due:2017-04-15

Using the "all" command you can search while ignoring thresholds.

    $ todo all
    1: Pick up milk @Groceries
    2: Pay next year's taxes t:2019-01-01 due:2019-04-15
    3: Pay last year's taxes t:2017-01-01 due:2017-04-15

Using the "searchall" command you can perform a regular expression search,
while ignoring thresholds.
